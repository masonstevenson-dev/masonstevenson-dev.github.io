To whoever out there may have stumbled upon this blog site: 



This site captures most of the tech art projects I worked on from ~2022-2025. Once upon a time, I was a software engineer at a big fancy tech company. I hated working there so I quit in order to pursue a career in game development. I failed. 



Originally this site was hosted with squarespace at [masonstevenson.dev](https://masonstevenson.dev/), but since I'm no longer actively pursuing a job in game development, I can't justify spending the $300/yr or whatever on squarespace. Plus as it turns out I ended up having to write a bunch of custom html and css to get my squarespace site looking the way I wanted it *anyway* so squarespace wasn't exactly making my life any more convenient. I'm happy to find that I've been able replicate like 95% of the old site here, so I guess I probably should have just used github pages from the jump.



I suppose there isn't much point to keeping this site up, but I worked harder on these projects than I've ever worked on anything in my life, and I want some record of the work I did to exist, even if nobody sees it. Its possible I may occasionally still post here, but I probably won't be doing any more detailed breakdowns or adding to my portfolio as I am now pretty busy with going back to school.
